        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p> 
            I’m Ivan Koyrushki, and I’m passionate about turning ideas into reality. Whether it’s through technology, design, or creative projects,
            I love exploring new challenges and sharing what I learn along the way. Welcome to my website — a space where I showcase my work,
            write about my experiences, and connect with people who share similar interests.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of the programming languages I know:</p>
        <ul >
            <li>C# – I often use it for game development, especially with Unity</li>
            <li>Java – Great for building applications and understanding object-oriented programming</li>
            <li>JavaScript – Perfect for creating interactive and dynamic websites</li>
        </ul>

         <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            One of my biggest hobbies is video games — both playing them and creating them. Ever since I was a kid,
            I’ve been fascinated by how games can transport you to new worlds, tell incredible stories, and challenge your skills and creativity.
            I love exploring different genres, from fast-paced action games to thoughtful puzzles and immersive RPGs.
            But my interest goes beyond playing. I’m deeply passionate about making my own video games. I enjoy learning how game mechanics work,
            designing levels, writing code, and experimenting with graphics and sound to bring unique ideas to life. Whether it’s working on small prototypes
            or bigger projects, I find the process exciting and endlessly rewarding.
            For me, video games are more than just entertainment — they’re a powerful form of art and communication.
            Through game development, I get to express my creativity, solve interesting problems, and share experiences with others.
            It’s a hobby that constantly pushes me to learn new skills and think in new ways, and I hope to keep growing 
            in this field and maybe even turn it into a career one day.
